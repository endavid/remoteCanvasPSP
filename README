Using WiFi Multitest .03 by PspPet as base, I added a simple chat-like program that just sends the other users your current coordinates, and visualizes other users' coordinates in the PSP screen. 

I added a small function that lets you choose the server's IP address (util.c), and a thread that listens to incoming messages.

The program comes with a simple Java server and 2 example clients. The server's default port is 4004.

One of the clients displays the movements as simple fires, and lets you chat briefly. 

The other client, moves the pointer, so you can remotely control your computer from your PSP. I used this during a presentation.

It's my first PSP program. I hope someone finds it useful!
